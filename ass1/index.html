  <h3>Verse 1</h3>
  <p class="yelling">Is this real life? Is this just fantasy?</p>
  <p class="sad">Carry on, carry on, as if nothing really matters</p>  
<p>Open my eyes, look up to the skies and see</p>
<p class="sad">I'm just a poor boy, I need no sympathy</p>
<p>Because I'm easy come, easy go, little high, little low</p>
<p class="sad">Any way the wind blows, doesn't really matter to me, to me</p>

<p>But now I've gone and thrown it all away</p>

  <h3>Verse 4</h3>
<p>I see a little silhouetto of a man</p>
